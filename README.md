# Neuroimpulse Website Refactoring

## Overview

This project features a comprehensive refactoring of the Neuroimpulse website to improve performance, maintainability, and user experience. The refactoring follows modern web development best practices and focuses on optimizing page load speed.

## Key Improvements

### Code Organization

- **Separation of Concerns**: Split HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into separate files
- **Modular JavaScript**: Organized JavaScript in a functional, modular pattern
- **Critical CSS**: Extracted critical CSS for faster initial rendering

### Performance Optimizations

- **Resource Loading**:
  - Critical CSS inlined for faster first render
  - Async loading of non-critical CSS
  - Deferred loading of JavaScript
  - Lazy loading of images below the fold
  - Preloaded critical resources (hero image, fonts)
  - Preconnect to external domains

- **JavaScript Optimization**:
  - Event delegation where appropriate
  - Modular functions with clear purposes
  - Deferred loading of analytics

- **CSS Optimization**:
  - CSS variables for consistent theming
  - Mobile-first responsive design
  - Reduced CSS specificity issues

### Browser Compatibility

- iOS-specific fixes for better mobile experience
- Fallbacks for browsers with JavaScript disabled

## Project Structure

```
neuroimpulse/
├── index.html           # Main HTML document with critical CSS
├── critical.css         # Critical CSS for above-the-fold content
├── app.js               # Main JavaScript file
├── image/               # Image assets
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

## Performance Metrics

Performance should be measured before and after the refactoring using:
- Lighthouse scores
- PageSpeed Insights
- Core Web Vitals metrics
- Network waterfall analysis

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further optimization:
- Implement service worker for offline capabilities
- Further image optimization (WebP format)
- Add HTTP/2 server push for critical assets
- Consider static site generation for even faster loading
- Set up a proper build process with minification

## Browser Support

The site has been tested and optimized for:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- iOS Safari
- Android Chrome
